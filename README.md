# Machine-Learning-Project-
Predicting NASDAQ Composite Index Using Deep  Learning Models

This project was completed with three classmates in my Machine Learning Class. Our goal was to use deep learning models, specifically Gated Recurrent Units and Long Short Term, to predict the price of the NASDAQ composite index. The data folder contains data of the index from 2002 to 2021. The file 'WKB_comsc355_FinalProject' contains all the code for this project. The Results folder is a compilation of graphs and results from the models tested, many of these graphs can also be found in the code. The file 'WKB_comsc355_FinalProject_Paper' is the report that we wrote based on these results.
